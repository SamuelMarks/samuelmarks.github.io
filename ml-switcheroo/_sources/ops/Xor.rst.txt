Xor
===

Returns the tensor resulted from performing the `xor` logical operation elementwise on the input tensors `A` and `B` (with Numpy-style broadcasting support). This operator supports **multidirectional (i.e., Numpy-style) broadcasting**; for more details please check [the doc](Broadcasting.md).

**Abstract Signature:**

``Xor(A: Tensor, B: Tensor, decay_factor: float, epsilon: float, norm_coefficient: float)``
