AveragePool
===========

AveragePool consumes an input tensor X and applies average pooling across the tensor according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths. average pooling consisting of computing the average on all values of a subset of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the data into...

**Abstract Signature:**

``AveragePool(X: Tensor, auto_pad: str, ceil_mode: int, count_include_pad: int, dilations: List[int], kernel_shape: List[int], pads: List[int], strides: List[int])``
