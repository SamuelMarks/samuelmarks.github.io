.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   SASS Lifter Module.

   This module provides the logic to "lift" low-level SASS AST nodes back into a
   high-level `LogicalGraph`. It relies on semantic comment markers emitted during
   compilation (or manually annotated) to reconstruct the control flow.

   Updates:
   - Integrates `SassAnalyzer` to parse instructions between BEGIN/END markers.
   - Populates `LogicalNode.metadata` with extracted parameters.

Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: SassLifter

   Reconstructs a LogicalGraph from a sequence of SASS AST nodes.


   .. py:method:: lift(nodes: List[ml_switcheroo.core.sass.nodes.SassNode]) -> ml_switcheroo.core.graph.LogicalGraph

      Parses a list of SASS nodes to build a LogicalGraph.

      Captures instructions within BEGIN/END blocks to feed into the Analyzer.
