RotaryEmbedding
===============

RotaryEmbedding is the implementation of rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864. The key advantage of RoPE is that it allows the model to understand both the absolute position of a token and the relative distances between tokens. This is achieved thro...
