NonMaxSuppression
=================

Filter out boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap with previously selected boxes. Bounding boxes with score less than score_threshold are removed. Bounding box format is indicated by attribute center_point_box. Note that this algorithm is agnostic to where the origin is in the co...
