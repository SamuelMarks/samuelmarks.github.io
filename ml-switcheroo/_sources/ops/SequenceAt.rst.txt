SequenceAt
==========

Outputs a tensor copy from the tensor at 'position' in 'input_sequence'. Accepted range for 'position' is in `[-n, n - 1]`, where `n` is the number of tensors in 'input_sequence'. Negative value means counting positions from the back.

**Abstract Signature:**

``SequenceAt(input_sequence, position)``
