DFT
===

Computes the discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input. Assuming the input has shape `[M, N]`, where `N` is the dimension over which the DFT is computed and `M` denotes the conceptual "all other dimensions," the DFT `y[m, k]` of shape `[M, N]` is defined as $$y[m, k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{-2 \pi...
