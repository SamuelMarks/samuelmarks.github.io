MaxUnpool
=========

MaxUnpool essentially computes the partial inverse of the MaxPool op. The input information to this op is typically the output information from a MaxPool op. The first input tensor X is the tensor that needs to be unpooled, which is typically the pooled tensor (first output) from MaxPool. The second...

**Abstract Signature:**

``MaxUnpool(X, I, output_shape, kernel_shape: List[int], pads: List[int], strides: List[int])``
