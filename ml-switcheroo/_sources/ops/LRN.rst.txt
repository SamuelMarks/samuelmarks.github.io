Local Response Normalization proposed in the [AlexNet paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf). It normalizes over local input regions. The local region is defined across the channels. For an element `X[n, c, d1, ..., dk]` in a ten...
