AffineGrid
==========

Generates a 2D or 3D flow field (sampling grid), given a batch of affine matrices theta (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.affine_grid.html). An affine matrix `theta` is applied to a position tensor represented in its homogeneous expression. Here is an example in 3D: ``` ...

**Abstract Signature:**
