Col2Im
======

The operator rearranges column blocks back into a multidimensional image Col2Im behaves similarly to PyTorch's fold https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Fold.html, but it only supports *batched* multi-dimensional image tensors. Another implementation in Python with N-dimension support ...

**Abstract Signature:**

``Col2Im(input: Tensor, image_shape: int, block_shape: int, dilations: List[int], pads: List[int], strides: List[int])``
