ReverseSequence
===============

Reverse batch of sequences having different lengths specified by `sequence_lens`. For each slice i iterating on batch axis, the operator reverses the first sequence_lens[i] elements on time axis, and copies elements whose index's beyond sequence_lens[i] to the output. So the output slice i contains ...

**Abstract Signature:**

``ReverseSequence(input: Tensor, sequence_lens: int, batch_axis: int, time_axis: int)``
