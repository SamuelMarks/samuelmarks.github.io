DeformConv
==========

Performs deformable convolution as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06211 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11168. This operator specification supports the general N-D case. Note that most common use cases have 2D or 3D data.

**Abstract Signature:**

``DeformConv(X: Tensor, W: Tensor, offset: Tensor, B: Tensor, mask: Tensor, dilations: List[int], group: int, kernel_shape: List[int], offset_group: int, pads: List[int], strides: List[int])``
