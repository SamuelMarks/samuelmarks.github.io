ml_switcheroo.discovery.syncer
==============================

.. py:module:: ml_switcheroo.discovery.syncer

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Discovery Tool for linking Framework implementations to Standards.

   This module scans installed libraries (e.g., Torch, JAX, TensorFlow, MLX) for
   functions that match the names defined in the Semantic Knowledge Base.

   Refactor Note:
       Hardcoded search paths have been removed. This module now queries the
       `ml_switcheroo.frameworks` registry to determine which submodules to scan
       for a given framework. This enables "Zero-Edit" support for new frameworks.

Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: FrameworkSyncer

   Links abstract operations to concrete framework implementations.

   This class iterates through registered modules of a target framework, looking for
   callables that match the operation names defined in the Semantic Knowledge Base.
   It verifies that potential matches have compatible signatures before linking them.

   .. attribute:: console

      A configured Rich console for logging output.


   .. py:attribute:: console


   .. py:method:: sync(tier_data: Dict[str, Any], framework: str) -> None

      Updates the 'variants' dict in tier_data by hunting for ops in the target framework.

      It resolves the `FrameworkAdapter` for the requested framework to determine
      the list of python submodules to scan (e.g. `['jax.numpy', 'jax.numpy.fft']`).

      If a function with a matching name and compatible signature is found, it is
      recorded in the `tier_data` dictionary under the `variants` key.

      :param tier_data: The Semantic Knowledge Base (dictionary of operations).
                        This dictionary is modified in-place.
      :param framework: The target framework name (e.g., 'torch', 'tensorflow', 'mlx').
