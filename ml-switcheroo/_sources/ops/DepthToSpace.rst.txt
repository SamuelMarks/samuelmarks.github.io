DepthToSpace
============

DepthToSpace rearranges (permutes) data from depth into blocks of spatial data. This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToDepth. More specifically, this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the depth dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the height and width dimensions. By d...
