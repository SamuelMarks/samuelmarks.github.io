TensorScatter
=============

TensorScatter is a generic tensor update operation, motivated by the requirements for KV cache updates for Attention ops commonly found in LLMs. It is a functional operation that models an in-place update to a KV cache buffer. The past and present cache tensors have the same shape (batch_size, D1, D...

**Abstract Signature:**

``TensorScatter(past_cache: Tensor, update: Tensor, write_indices: int, axis: int, mode: str)``
