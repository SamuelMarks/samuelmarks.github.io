===============

ScatterElements takes three inputs `data`, `updates`, and `indices` of the same rank r >= 1 and an optional attribute axis that identifies an axis of `data` (by default, the outer-most axis, that is axis 0). The output of the operation is produced by creating a copy of the input `data`, and then upd...
