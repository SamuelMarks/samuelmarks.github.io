ml_switcheroo.semantics.autogen
===============================

.. py:module:: ml_switcheroo.semantics.autogen

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Semantic Autogen: The Persistence Layer.

   This module is responsible for finalizing "Candidate Standards" proposed by the
   Consensus Engine into the JSON Semantic Knowledge Base.

   It implements a "Do Not Harm" policy:
   - If a standard already exists in the file (implying manual curation or previous sync),
     it is skipped to prevent overwriting high-quality manual edits with automated guesses.
   - New discoveries are strictly additive.
   - Supports atomic rewrites of the JSON database.

Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: SemanticPersister

   Handles serialization of Discovered Standards to disk.

   Transforms internal CandidateStandard objects into the Switcheroo Semantic Schema
   and merges them safely into existing definition files.


   .. py:method:: persist(candidates: List[ml_switcheroo.discovery.consensus.CandidateStandard], target_file: pathlib.Path) -> None

      Merges discovered candidates into the target JSON file and saves it.

      :param candidates: List of aligned CandidateStandard objects.
      :param target_file: Path to the JSON semantic file (e.g. k_framework_extras.json).
