SequenceMap
===========

Applies a sub-graph to each sample in the input sequence(s). Inputs can be either tensors or sequences, with the exception of the first input which must be a sequence. The length of the first input sequence will determine the number of samples in the outputs. Any other sequence inputs should have th...
