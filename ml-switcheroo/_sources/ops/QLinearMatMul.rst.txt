QLinearMatMul
=============

Matrix product that behaves like [numpy.matmul](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html). It consumes two quantized input tensors, their scales and zero points, scale and zero point of output, and computes the quantized output. The quantization formula is y = saturate((x /...

**Abstract Signature:**

``QLinearMatMul(a, a_scale, a_zero_point, b, b_scale, b_zero_point, y_scale, y_zero_point)``
