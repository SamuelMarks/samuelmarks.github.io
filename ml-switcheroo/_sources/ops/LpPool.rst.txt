LpPool
======

LpPool consumes an input tensor X and applies Lp pooling across the tensor according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths. Lp pooling consisting of computing the Lp norm on all values of a subset of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the data into the output ten...

**Abstract Signature:**

``LpPool(X: Tensor, auto_pad: str, ceil_mode: int, dilations: List[int], kernel_shape: List[int], p: int, pads: List[int], strides: List[int])``
