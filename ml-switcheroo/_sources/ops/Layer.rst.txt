Layer
=====

This is the class from which all layers inherit.

A layer is a callable object that takes as input one or more tensors and
that outputs one or more tensors. It involves *computation*, defined
in the `call()` method, and a *state* (weight variables). State can be
created:

* in `__init__()`, for instance via `self.add_weight()`;
* in the optional `build()` method, which is invoked by the first
  `__call__()` to the layer, and supplies the shape(s) of the input(s),
  which may not have been known at initialization time.

Layers are recursively composable: If you assign a Layer instance as an
attribute of another Layer, the outer layer will start tracking the weights
created by the inner layer. Nested layers should be instantiated in the
`__init__()` method or `build()` method.

Users will just instantiate a layer and then treat it as a callable.

Args:
    trainable: Boolean, whether the layer's variables should be trainable.
    name: String name of the layer.
    dtype: The dtype of the layer's computations and weights. Can also be a
        `keras.DTypePolicy`, which allows the computation and weight dtype
        to differ. Defaults to `None`. `None` means to use
        `keras.config.dtype_policy()`, which is a `float32` policy unless
        set to different value (via `keras.config.set_dtype_policy()`).

Attributes:
    name: The name of the layer (string).
    dtype: Dtype of the layer's weights. Alias of `layer.variable_dtype`.
    variable_dtype: Dtype of the layer's weights.
    compute_dtype: The dtype of the layer's computations.
        Layers automatically cast inputs to this dtype, which causes
        the computations and output to also be in this dtype.
        When mixed precision is used with a
        `keras.DTypePolicy`, this will be different
        than `variable_dtype`.
    trainable_weights: List of variables to be included in backprop.
    non_trainable_weights: List of variables that should not be
        included in backprop.
    weights: The concatenation of the lists trainable_weights and
        non_trainable_weights (in this order).
    trainable: Whether the layer should be trained (boolean), i.e.
        whether its potentially-trainable weights should be returned
        as part of `layer.trainable_weights`.
    input_spec: Optional (list of) `InputSpec` object(s) specifying the
        constraints on inputs that can be accepted by the layer.

We recommend that descendants of `Layer` implement the following methods:

* `__init__()`: Defines custom layer attributes, and creates layer weights
    that do not depend on input shapes, using `add_weight()`,
    or other state.
* `build(self, input_shape)`: This method can be used to create weights that
    depend on the shape(s) of the input(s), using `add_weight()`, or other
    state. `__call__()` will automatically build the layer
    (if it has not been built yet) by calling `build()`.
* `call(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Called in `__call__` after making
    sure `build()` has been called. `call()` performs the logic of applying
    the layer to the input arguments.
    Two reserved keyword arguments you can optionally use in `call()` are:
        1. `training` (boolean, whether the call is in inference mode or
            training mode).
        2. `mask` (boolean tensor encoding masked timesteps in the input,
            used e.g. in RNN layers).
    A typical signature for this method is `call(self, inputs)`, and user
    could optionally add `training` and `mask` if the layer need them.
* `get_config(self)`: Returns a dictionary containing the configuration
    used to initialize this layer. If the keys differ from the arguments
    in `__init__()`, then override `from_config(self)` as well.
    This method is used when saving
    the layer or a model that contains this layer.

Examples:

Here's a basic example: a layer with two variables, `w` and `b`,
that returns `y = w . x + b`.
It shows how to implement `build()` and `call()`.
Variables set as attributes of a layer are tracked as weights
of the layers (in `layer.weights`).

```python
class SimpleDense(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super().__init__()
        self.units = units

    # Create the state of the layer (weights)
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name="kernel",
        )
        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,),
            initializer="zeros",
            trainable=True,
            name="bias",
        )

    # Defines the computation
    def call(self, inputs):
        return ops.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias

# Instantiates the layer.
linear_layer = SimpleDense(4)

# This will also call `build(input_shape)` and create the weights.
y = linear_layer(ops.ones((2, 2)))
assert len(linear_layer.weights) == 2

# These weights are trainable, so they're listed in `trainable_weights`:
assert len(linear_layer.trainable_weights) == 2
```

Besides trainable weights, updated via backpropagation during training,
layers can also have non-trainable weights. These weights are meant to
be updated manually during `call()`. Here's a example layer that computes
the running sum of its inputs:

```python
class ComputeSum(Layer):

  def __init__(self, input_dim):
      super(ComputeSum, self).__init__()
      # Create a non-trainable weight.
      self.total = self.add_weight(
        shape=(),
        initializer="zeros",
        trainable=False,
        name="total",
      )

  def call(self, inputs):
      self.total.assign(self.total + ops.sum(inputs))
      return self.total

my_sum = ComputeSum(2)
x = ops.ones((2, 2))
y = my_sum(x)

assert my_sum.weights == [my_sum.total]
assert my_sum.non_trainable_weights == [my_sum.total]
assert my_sum.trainable_weights == []
```
