GatherND
========

Given `data` tensor of rank `r` >= 1, `indices` tensor of rank `q` >= 1, and `batch_dims` integer `b`, this operator gathers slices of `data` into an output tensor of rank `q + r - indices_shape[-1] - 1 - b`. `indices` is an q-dimensional integer tensor, best thought of as a `(q-1)`-dimensional tens...
