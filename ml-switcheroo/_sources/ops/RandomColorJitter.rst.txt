RandomColorJitter
=================

RandomColorJitter class randomly apply brightness, contrast, saturation
and hue image processing operation sequentially and randomly on the
input.

**Note:** This layer is safe to use inside a `tf.data` or `grain` pipeline
(independently of which backend you're using).

Args:
    value_range: the range of values the incoming images will have.
        Represented as a two number tuple written [low, high].
        This is typically either `[0, 1]` or `[0, 255]` depending
        on how your preprocessing pipeline is set up.
    brightness_factor: Float or a list/tuple of 2 floats between -1.0
        and 1.0. The factor is used to determine the lower bound and
        upper bound of the brightness adjustment. A float value will
        be chosen randomly between the limits. When -1.0 is chosen,
        the output image will be black, and when 1.0 is chosen, the
        image will be fully white. When only one float is provided,
        eg, 0.2, then -0.2 will be used for lower bound and 0.2 will
        be used for upper bound.
    contrast_factor: a positive float represented as fraction of value,
        or a tuple of size 2 representing lower and upper bound. When
        represented as a single float, lower = upper. The contrast
        factor will be randomly picked between `[1.0 - lower, 1.0 +
        upper]`. For any pixel x in the channel, the output will be
        `(x - mean) * factor + mean` where `mean` is the mean value
        of the channel.
    saturation_factor: A tuple of two floats or a single float. `factor`
        controls the extent to which the image saturation is impacted.
        `factor=0.5` makes this layer perform a no-op operation.
        `factor=0.0` makes the image fully grayscale. `factor=1.0`
        makes the image fully saturated. Values should be between
        `0.0` and `1.0`. If a tuple is used, a `factor` is sampled
        between the two values for every image augmented. If a single
        float is used, a value between `0.0` and the passed float is
        sampled. To ensure the value is always the same, pass a tuple
        with two identical floats: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
    hue_factor: A single float or a tuple of two floats. `factor`
        controls the extent to which the image hue is impacted.
        `factor=0.0` makes this layer perform a no-op operation,
        while a value of `1.0` performs the most aggressive contrast
        adjustment available. If a tuple is used, a `factor` is
        sampled between the two values for every image augmented.
        If a single float is used, a value between `0.0` and the
        passed float is sampled. In order to ensure the value is
        always the same, please pass a tuple with two identical
        floats: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
    seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
