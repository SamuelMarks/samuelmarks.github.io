GridSample
==========

Given an input `X` and a flow-field `grid`, computes the output `Y` using `X` values and pixel locations from the `grid`. For spatial input `X` with shape (N, C, H, W), the `grid` will have shape (N, H_out, W_out, 2), the output `Y` will have shape (N, C, H_out, W_out). For volumetric input `X` with...
