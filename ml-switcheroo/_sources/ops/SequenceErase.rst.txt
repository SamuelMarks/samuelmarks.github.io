SequenceErase
=============

Outputs a tensor sequence that removes the tensor at 'position' from 'input_sequence'. Accepted range for 'position' is in `[-n, n - 1]`, where `n` is the number of tensors in 'input_sequence'. Negative value means counting positions from the back. 'position' is optional, by default it erases the la...
