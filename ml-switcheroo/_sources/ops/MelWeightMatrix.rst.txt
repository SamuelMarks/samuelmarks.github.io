MelWeightMatrix
===============

Generate a MelWeightMatrix that can be used to re-weight a Tensor containing a linearly sampled frequency spectra (from DFT or STFT) into num_mel_bins frequency information based on the [lower_edge_hertz, upper_edge_hertz] range on the mel scale. This function defines the mel scale in terms of a fre...

**Abstract Signature:**

``MelWeightMatrix(num_mel_bins, dft_length, sample_rate, lower_edge_hertz, upper_edge_hertz, output_datatype: int)``
