SequenceInsert
==============

Outputs a tensor sequence that inserts 'tensor' into 'input_sequence' at 'position'. 'tensor' must have the same data type as 'input_sequence'. Accepted range for 'position' is in `[-n, n]`, where `n` is the number of tensors in 'input_sequence'. Negative value means counting positions from the back...

**Abstract Signature:**

``SequenceInsert(input_sequence, tensor: Tensor, position)``
