QuantizeLinear
==============

The linear quantization operator consumes a high-precision tensor, a scale, and a zero point to compute the low-precision/quantized tensor. The scale factor and zero point must have the same shape, determining the quantization granularity. The quantization formula is `y = saturate((x / y_scale) + y_...
