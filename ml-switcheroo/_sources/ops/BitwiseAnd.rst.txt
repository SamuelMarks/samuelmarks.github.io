BitwiseAnd
==========

Returns the tensor resulting from performing the bitwise `and` operation elementwise on the input tensors `A` and `B` (with Numpy-style broadcasting support). This operator supports **multidirectional (i.e., Numpy-style) broadcasting**; for more details please check [the doc](Broadcasting.md).

**Abstract Signature:**

``BitwiseAnd(A: Tensor, B: Tensor)``
