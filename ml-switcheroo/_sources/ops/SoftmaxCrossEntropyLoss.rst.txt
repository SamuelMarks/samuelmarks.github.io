SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss
=======================

Loss function that measures the softmax cross entropy between 'scores' and 'labels'. This operator first computes a loss tensor whose shape is identical to the labels input. If the input is 2-D with shape (N, C), the loss tensor may be a N-element vector L = (l_1, l_2, ..., l_N). If the input is N-D...
