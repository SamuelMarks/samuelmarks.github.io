Generate a 2D tensor (matrix) with ones on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else. Only 2D tensors are supported, i.e. input T1 must be of rank 2. The shape of the output tensor is the same as the input tensor. The data type can be specified by the 'dtype' argument. If 'dtype' is not specified, then...
