Hardmax
=======

The operator computes the hardmax values for the given input: Hardmax(element in input, axis) = 1 if the element is the first maximum value along the specified axis, 0 otherwise The "axis" attribute indicates the dimension along which Hardmax will be performed. The output tensor has the same shape a...
