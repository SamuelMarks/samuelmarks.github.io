BitShift
========

Bitwise shift operator performs element-wise operation. For each input element, if the attribute "direction" is "RIGHT", this operator moves its binary representation toward the right side so that the input value is effectively decreased. If the attribute "direction" is "LEFT", bits of binary repres...
