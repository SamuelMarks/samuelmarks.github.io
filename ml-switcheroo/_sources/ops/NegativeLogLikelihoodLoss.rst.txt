NegativeLogLikelihoodLoss
=========================

A NegativeLogLikelihoodLoss operator computes (weighted) negative log likelihood loss. Its "input" tensor has the shape of (N, C, d1, d2, ..., dk) where k >= 0. The "input" tensor contains log-probabilities for input[n, :, d_1, d_2,..., d_k] being in a class of [0, C). The operator's "target" input ...
