ScatterND
=========

ScatterND takes three inputs `data` tensor of rank r >= 1, `indices` tensor of rank q >= 1, and `updates` tensor of rank q + r - indices.shape[-1] - 1. The output of the operation is produced by creating a copy of the input `data`, and then updating its value to values specified by `updates` at spec...

**Abstract Signature:**

``ScatterND(data: Tensor, indices: int, updates: Tensor, reduction: str)``
