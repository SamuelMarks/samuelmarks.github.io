InstanceNormalization
=====================

Carries out instance normalization as described in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022. y = scale * (x - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon) + B, where mean and variance are computed per instance per channel.

**Abstract Signature:**

``InstanceNormalization(input: Tensor, scale: Tensor, B: Tensor, epsilon: float)``

*No implementations mapped.*
