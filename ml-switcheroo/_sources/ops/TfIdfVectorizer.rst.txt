TfIdfVectorizer
===============

This transform extracts n-grams from the input sequence and save them as a vector. Input can be either a 1-D or 2-D tensor. For 1-D input, output is the n-gram representation of that input. For 2-D input, the output is also a  2-D tensor whose i-th row is the n-gram representation of the i-th input ...

**Abstract Signature:**
