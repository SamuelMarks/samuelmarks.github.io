ConvInteger
===========

The integer convolution operator consumes an input tensor, its zero-point, a filter, and its zero-point, and computes the output. The production MUST never overflow. The accumulation may overflow if and only if in 32 bits.

**Abstract Signature:**

``ConvInteger(x, w, x_zero_point, w_zero_point, auto_pad: str, dilations: List[int], group: int, kernel_shape: List[int], pads: List[int], strides: List[int])``
