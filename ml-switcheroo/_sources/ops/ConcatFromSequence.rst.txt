ConcatFromSequence
==================

Concatenate a sequence of tensors into a single tensor. All input tensors must have the same shape, except for the dimension size of the axis to concatenate on. By default 'new_axis' is 0, the behavior is similar to numpy.concatenate. When 'new_axis' is 1, the behavior is similar to numpy.stack.

**Abstract Signature:**

``ConcatFromSequence(input_sequence, axis: int, new_axis: int)``
